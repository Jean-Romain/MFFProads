#' Snap road endings
#'
#' Snap road endings together, with or without prior knowledge on road connections, to post-process
#' and correct inaccuracies generated by \link{measure_roads} and ensure getting topologically valid
#' network. If argument 'ref' is missing the method is very basic. The method using a reference map
#' is more advanced.
#'
#' @param roads  multiple lines (\code{sf} format). Corrected but unconnected roads.
#' @param ref  multiple lines (\code{sf} format). Original non-corrected but connected roads. Can be
#' missing.
#' @param tolerance numeric (distance unit). Tolerance value used to snap the road endings.
#' @param field  character. Unique identifier field in both road datasets. Relevant only if 'ref' is
#' not missing.
#' @param updatable logical. Vector identifing which road segments need to be snapped (default is all
#' segments). Relevant only if 'ref' is not missing.
#'
#' @return Named list with \code{roads} being the same object as \code{roads} but with corrected endings
#' such that roads are connected and \code{warnings} being either \code{NULL} or a \code{sf POINT}
#' identifying nodes with issues.
