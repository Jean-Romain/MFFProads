#' Parameters
#'
#' Parameters for function \link{measure_road}. Keeping 'as is' is recommended.
#'
#' **extraction**: parameters used to extract the point cloud, process it into small sections
#' and compute profiles
#'
#' - **road_max_len**: maximum size of a processed road. If longer than that it will be split in
#' chunks of equal sizes such as no one is more than this size.
#' - **road_max_width**: maximum width of a road for metrics measurements
#' - **road_buffer**: width of a buffer around the road for point-cloud extraction
#' - **section_length**: length of sections of road for metrics measurements
#' - **profile_resolution**: resolution of the profiles and DTMs for metrics measurements
#'
#' **constraint**: parameters to contraint the road relocation step
#'  - **confidence** The confidence you have on the location of the reference roads. 1 means
#' that the road is 100\% a ground truth. This will skip the relocation step. High values mean high
#' confidence that the reference road is correct and this will help the algorithm. Low values leave
#' more freedom to the algorithm but it becomes also more prone to errors. However this parameter is
#' not very sensitive.
#'
#'
#' **embankments**: parameters to detect embankments in the terrain
#'
#' - **min_slope**: slope (degrees) greater may initiate or terminate the detection of embankments
#'
#' **terrain**: parameters to detect road based on the terrain aspect (excluding embankment)
#'
#' - **max_sd_ground_points**: point belonging on road have a low dispersion on Z.
#' maximum standard deviation to be considered as low dispersion
#' - **max_elevation_ground_points**: once normalized relatively to the potential road
#' all the points are expected to be at 0. This is the tolerance.
#'
#' **state**: parameters to evaluate the state of a section
#'
#' - **percentage_veg_thresholds**:
#' - **drivable_width_thresholds**:
