\usage{
measure_road(
  ctg,
  centerline,
  dtm = NULL,
  conductivity = NULL,
  water = NULL,
  param = alsroads_default_parameters,
  ...
)

measure_roads(
  ctg,
  roads,
  dtm,
  conductivity = NULL,
  water = NULL,
  param = alsroads_default_parameters
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctg}{a non-normalized \link[lidR:LAScatalog-class]{LAScatalog} object from lidR package}

\item{centerline}{a single linestring (sf format) used as reference to search and measure the road.}

\item{dtm}{RasterLayer storing the DTM with a resolution of at least of 1 m. Can be computed
with \link[lidR:grid_terrain]{grid_terrain}. It can be missing if a conductivity layer is provided}

\item{conductivity}{RasterLayer storing the pre-computed conductivity. It can be NULL in this case
if will be computed on the fly but the layer can be pre-computed with \link{rasterize_conductivity}}

\item{water}{a set of spatial polygons (sf format) of water bodies. This is used to mask the water
bodies so they cannot be mistaken as a drivable surfaces. Not mandatory but can help. It also allows
to detect bridges above water.}

\item{param}{a list of many parameters. See \link{alsroads_default_parameters}.}

\item{...}{unused}

\item{roads}{multiple lines (sf format) used as reference to search and measure the roads}
}
\value{
An sf object similar to the input with additional attributes and an updated geometry. If
the class is 3 or 4 the original geometry is preserved to prevent adding more error. The new attributes
are ROADWITH, DRIVABLEWIDTH, PERCABOVEROAD (percentage of points between 0.5 and 5 meter above the road)
SHOULDERS (average number of shoulders found), SINUOSITY, CONDUCTIVITY (conductivity per linear meters)
SCORE (a road state score) and CLASS (4 classes derived from the SCORE). See references
}
\description{
From a reference road (spatial line), extracts the line with a buffer from the point cloud and computes
the exact positioning of the road (realignment). Then, using new the accurate shape, computes
road metrics including its width, its drivable width, its sinuosity as well as its state in four
classes. The function \link{st_snap_lines} allows to post-process the output to fix minor inaccuracies
 and reconnect the roads that may no longer be connected because each road is processed independently.
